Problem D: Team Decision
It is the ICPC season again, and one of the crucial things your team has to decide is which regional (Amrita or Kanpur) to go to. In order to maximize your team's chances of 
success, your team should go to the regional that none of your rivals are going to. In fact, every team has this same objective. 

Now, assuming that each team goes to exactly one regional and knowing the set of rivals for each team, how many ways are there of assigning teams to regionals such 
that the above objective is satisfied? 

The rivalry relation is not symmetric. That is, team A may think of team B as its rival, but not vice versa. Also, two assignments of teams (to Amrita and Kanpur) 
are considered different if the set of teams assigned to either regional differs (between the assignments). Since the number of ways can go too large, your answer 
should be output modulo 10^9 + 7. 
Input (STDIN):

The first line gives the number of test-cases, T.
Each test case begins with N, the number of teams registered. Teams are numbered 0 to N-1.
The next N lines describe the rivalry relation: the i'th of these lines begins with an integer K (between 0 and N-1), denoting the number of rivals of the i'th team. 
This is followed by K integers, denoting the rivals of the i'th team.
There is a blank line after each test case.
Output (STDOUT):

For each test case, output the possible number of assignments to the two regionals such that no team goes to the same regional as any of its rivals. Don't forget 
to output your answer modulo 10^9 + 7.
Constraints:

T <= 10
N <= 20,000
Total number of rivalries among all teams <= 100,000
Sample Input:

2
4
2 1 3
2 0 2
2 1 3
2 0 2

2
1 1
0
Sample Output:

2
2
Explanation:

In the first test case, teams 0 & 2 think that 1 & 3 are their rivals, and vice versa. So, the 2 possibilities are {0, 2} going to Amrita and {1, 3} going to Kanpur, or {0, 2} going to Kanpur and {1, 3} going to Amrita.
